                                <strong>We may use and disclose your health information for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations to provide you with quality health care.</strong><br><br>Health information may identify you and may relate to your past, present, or future health condition related to the healthcare services received at our facility, or information that may be forwarded to us from other providers (doctors, hospitals, etc.).
